# DigiSpark Red Light Green Light Game

I made my kids a simple handheld Red Light/Green Light indicator for the game with the same name. Can run off a USB Battery Bank.

## Parts Used:
* Generic $2 DigiSpark
* Single WS2812 LED aka NeoPixel

I wired the LED to the DigiSpark using solid core wire so I can bend it whichever way needed. I either stand up the DigiSpark for the kids to see or they run around with it screaming Red Light! Green Light!
